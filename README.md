# Seine

A creator of alternative renderings of Ellsworth Kelly's 1951 painting, *Seine*. The project is built in Python, and uses the Image module from the Python Imaging Library (PIL.)

## Background

In 1951, Ellsworth Kelly painted *Seine*, in which:
* "Each of the first 41 columns contains one more black rectangle than the one to its left."
* "Each of the next 40 following columns contains one more white rectangle than the one to its left."

(Quotes from [here](http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~chb/kelly/chen_bryan_artofresearch.pdf).)

In creating this piece, Kelly both represented the Seine, a Parisian river, and stumbled upon many of the notions that are at the core of [percolation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory).

Today, *Seine* is held at the [Philadelphia Museum of Art](http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/295031.html).
